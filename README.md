# Work-day-scheduler

## Description

This webpage is meant to display a current daily schedule that can be cleared out after each day with a clear button. The timing is set for a typical workday- 9am to 5pm- and when you input text for a given hour it will stay there until the information is cleared out. The schedule is color coordinated, with red being the current hour, grey being the past, and green being the future. There is a clock displayed at the top of the page where it is counting each second.
